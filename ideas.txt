Interesting Explorations Done:
1. Missing data for each feature
2. 10 most common predictors
3. Correlations between the predictors
4. Correlations between interesting features to the predictors
5. Global predictor trend

Interesting Explorations TODO:
1. Measure similarity between users
2. Look at users that are similar at a single point in time, and check if their decisions are similar also.

Possible models:
1. try to compare single user with similar users (collaborative filtering algorithms)
2. try to predict based on user history (timeseries prediction algorithms)
3. try timeseries prediction at large scale (look at the most common predictors, and the global trend of each predictor, and decide if buy is probable)
4. try to model as a classification problem - based on all the current features and predictors, what would be the decision next month? fit XGBoost or other.
