Interesting Explorations Done:
1. Missing data for each feature
2. 10 most common predictors
3. Correlations between the predictors
4. Correlations between interesting features to the predictors
5. Global predictor trend
6. The best kaggle score divided by best possible score - how much of the change is explainable by the data.
7. Binary assymetric correlation between predictors
8. 10 most common residence countries (we can infer this feature is useless, only 0.5% of users are outside spain)
9. province customer count histogram
10. histograms for many different features

Interesting Explorations TODO:
SIMILARITY BASED
1. Measure similarity between users
2. Look at users that are similar at a single point in time, and check if their decisions are similar also. Is it common that 2 users with similar stats, choose differently?
3. Try to visualize clustering/grouping of similar users.

OTHER
1. try to understand if there is a reason to look at the old history of the user, when predicting his next move (in such cases, timeseries prediction is the correct approach), or the current point in time is the only thing relevant. Maybe, if a person got rid of a certain asset in the past, it influences the probability he would reaquire it. it is possible we can encapsulate the timeseries information in engineered features, and do regular classification.

Possible models:
1. try to model as a classification problem - based on all the current features and predictors, what would be the decision next month? fit XGBoost or other.
2. try timeseries prediction at large scale (look at the most common predictors, and the global trend of each predictor, and decide if buy is probable)
3. try to predict based on user history (timeseries prediction algorithms)
4. try to compare single user with similar users (collaborative filtering algorithms)
5. try hybrid models - combining (stacking or otherwise) predictions of several of the previous approaches

Additional Tasks:
1. What is the score acheived by baseline models? how does it compare to results in the leaderboard of Kaggle? Possible baselines:
    a. per label logistic regression.
    b. random forest.
    c. prediction based on the global predictor stats.
2. try models with missing values and with filled values, check which is better.
3. add features, for each predictor, signifying how long the user had the label, (maybe also for how long?).
